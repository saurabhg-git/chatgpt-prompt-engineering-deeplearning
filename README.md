# ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers
Jupyter code notebooks of "ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers" by DeepLearning.AI and OpenAI.

In ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers, you will learn how to use a large language model (LLM) to quickly build new and powerful applications.  Using the OpenAI API, youâ€™ll be able to quickly build capabilities that learn to innovate and create value in ways that were cost-prohibitive, highly technical, or simply impossible before now.

This short course taught by Isa Fulford (OpenAI) and Andrew Ng (DeepLearning.AI) will describe how LLMs work, provide best practices for prompt engineering, and show how LLM APIs can be used in applications for a variety of tasks, including:

- Summarizing (e.g., summarizing user reviews for brevity)
- Inferring (e.g., sentiment classification, topic extraction)
- Transforming text (e.g., translation, spelling & grammar correction)
- Expanding (e.g., automatically writing emails)


### Notes
Use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the principles of prompting that can be applied to software development. LLMs can be leveraged through API calls to quickly build software applications, but developers must provide clear and specific instructions, use short prompts with delimiters, and ask for structured output to ensure accuracy. Few-shot prompting and allowing the model time to think can also improve performance.

To reduce the risk of hallucinations, where the model generates plausible but untrue statements, developers must first find relevant information before answering questions. Iterative prompt development can also help improve performance over time by refining prompts based on error analysis.

In addition to these principles of prompting, there are various techniques that can be applied to NLP applications such as summarization, inferring sentiment and topics, transforming language, and expanding text. Temperature controls the degree of randomness in responses, and chatbots can be developed with a system behavior, assistant chat model, and user interaction.
